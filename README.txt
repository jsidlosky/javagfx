This is a java graphics test application

IDEA: Create the world on demand. So, it'll have to be maze like.  If you turn around, the world 
behind you is re-created to something new.  So no matter where you look, it is a new world to 
explore. This concept could be applied to a 2D or 3D game.  Even side scrolling games, maybe the map is
a set distance, but what you see in either direction, is created in real time.

Have a player use a shovel, pick-axe, sword and bow (copy minecraft) to work through a 2d randomly
generated world (still on the fly)
